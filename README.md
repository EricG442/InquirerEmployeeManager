## Installation

Node.js is required to use this application. 

Once the repository is cloned onto the system, run
```
npm i --production
```
in the root directory of the repository and use the .sql file  in the dev/db folder to setup the database from your MySQL workbench.

After the installation is finished run
```
node dev/init.js
```
to setup a connection between the application and your MySQL database. If you already have ran this command before the code will return a message saying it cannot be ran again.
## Usage

Once the installation and setup commands are all complete you can run
```
npm start
```
to start the application

This is a mock application of a console tool to be able to let a user interact with a MySQL database.
